# Wrangle-Analyze-We-Rate-Dogs-Twitter-Archive
WeRateDogs Twitter account has over 9 million followers and has received international media coverage. Due to the popularity of WeRateDogs, we decided to look into the statistics of the account and extract some data from the tweets.The Data used in this project was gathered from various sources, including downloading manually for dataset that is already available, using the requests library to download additional dataset from the link provided and using tweepy API, to gathered additional data that was needed. This resulted in collecting three datasets, which were then loaded into three seperate pandas dataframe namely(WeRateDogs, api_tweets, and Image_prediction). These datasets sets were assessed for Quality and Tidiness issues using visual assessment using Excel and programmatic assessment using python methods such as; .info(), .head(), .describe(), .value_counts(), etc.
